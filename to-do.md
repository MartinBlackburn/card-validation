#To-do

To get
* get images of cards (black & white/colour, to show what card type)

Ideas
* minimal form (idealy only card name and number, start/expiry date where needed)
* simple styles
* client side validation with minimal animations so not to distract

Needs to be able to
* recognise different card types from their numbers (regex)
* recognise if card is valid (regex)
